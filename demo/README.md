# Demonstration

The scripts in this directory shall serve as a quick demonstration on how `data-manager` (and SQLAlchemy) can be used to manipulate the data inside
the database (DB). The code is heavily commented in order to give guidance as to what is happening.

However, the examples are necessarily not exhaustive as SQLAlchemy essentially offers the complete power of SQL itself and therefore the general rule
of thumb is: if you can formulate what you want in words, there's almost certainly a way to do it. It's only a matter of reading the docs to figure
out _how_.
